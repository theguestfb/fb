# Fiction Branches FAQ

1. Why is the site read-only? 
    - Short answer: We’re currently developing  a new one.
    - Long answer: The server hosting the site was choking on traffic, so CountD moved it to a new server. When he did so, he set read-only mode while he developed an update to the site to prevent such problems in the future. Unfortunately, a few weeks after beginning, Countd went incongnito and we haven’t heard from him since.
    - Fortunately, Allison Voorhees owns the fictionbranches.net domain, and Phoenix has been building the new site from scratch. We’ve imported the data from the original site and development is under way.
2. Why can't I log in? 
    - Phoenix hasn’t implemented accounts on the read-only site, but the test site, test.fictionbranches.net is active and you can log in there.
3. When will the site be up? 
    - We’re not sure. At last analysis, it’s been looking like the site can go live by January 2018, but we need to re-assess soon. We’ll continue to keep this section updated.
4. How can I help?
    - You can help us test the new site at https://test.fictionbranches.net, or dedicate time or resources to [development](https://github.com/fictionbranches/fb). You can engage us on [irc](https://test.fictionbranches.net/static/irc.html) or [discord](https://discord.gg/eGPxp5A).
5. What is love?
    - Baby don’t hurt me. Don’t hurt me. No more.
