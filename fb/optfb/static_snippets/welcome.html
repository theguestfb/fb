<h3>Guidelines</h3>
<p>
Fiction Branches is an online software engine which allows the production of multi-plotted stories. Each story is divided into episodes comprising a page of text. Each page will have a title, a link back to the parent episode and the story text for that episode. At the end of each episode there can be one or more links to subsequent episodes, plus the option to add another branch to the story at that point.
<br /><br />
A new episode can be added to the story by clicking on the 'add new episode' link at the bottom of each episode. After doing this a form will be displayed enabling the user to add text for the new episode. When this has been done the parent episode will display a link to the new episode with the link text entered in the add new episode form.
<br /><br />
You must be a registered user and be logged in in order to add new episodes to the story. You may adjust user preferences by clicking your name in the top right corner of the page once you have logged in.
<br /><br />
Episodes may be edited by the moderators to remove any inappropriate content, correct errors, or correct parts of the story which are non-canon. Writers should try and write new episodes which maintain continuity with the story up to that point. Although note there is no need to make new episodes consistent with other story branches parallel to the one you're adding.
